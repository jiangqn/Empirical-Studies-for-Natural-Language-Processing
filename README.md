A resources list of empirical studies for natural language processing.

- **[ACL-19]** Do Neural Dialog Systems Use the Conversation History Effectively? An Empirical Study. [[paper]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1004.pdf) [[code]](https://github.com/chinnadhurai/ParlAI/)

- **[ACL-19]** Revisiting Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation:A Case Study. [[paper]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1021.pdf)
> This paper shows that with carefully tuned hyper-parameters NMT models can outperform SMT models even in the low-resource setting. Reducing BPE vocabulary size and word dropout are most useful tricks to improve the performance of NMT models when little parallel corpus is available.
